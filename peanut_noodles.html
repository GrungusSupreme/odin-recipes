            <p>My version of sesame peanut noodles comes together in just 20 minutes—perfect for a weeknight dinner—and requires minimal pantry ingredients</p>

              <p>The sauce bursts with nutty, sweet, and salty flavor. It makes a great side dish, but you can also add any protein and serve it as a main course!</p>
            
              <p>I like to use soba noodles in this recipe. They are chewy and have an earthy flavor which perfectly complements the peanut butter and sesame dressing.  If you can’t find soba noodles, rice noodles and egg noodles are also great options!</p>
            
              <p>These noodles are best served cold, which is GREAT because you don’t need to reheat them if you end up with leftovers. I like to garnish them with sesame seeds and sliced green onion, and serve them with steamed vegetables, like broccoli, bok choy, and zucchini.</p>

                    <li>2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil, divided</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons natural peanut butter</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 tablespoons honey</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
                    <li>1 clove garlic, grated</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds, for garnish (optional)</li>

                <h2>Method</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Cook the noodles:
                            Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add the noodles and cook following package instructions.
                            Drain into a colander set in the sink, then rinse with cold running water until cool to the touch. Drain well.                             
                            Transfer into a medium bowl and toss them with 1 tablespoon sesame oil so that they don’t stick to each other.
                            Cover with plastic wrap and place them in the fridge to keep cool while you prepare the sauce.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>Prepare the sauce:
                            In a small bowl, add the remaining 1 tablespoon sesame oil, peanut butter, soy sauce, honey, rice vinegar, and garlic.
                            Whisk with a fork until combined and smooth.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>Assemble the noodles:
                            Scrape the peanut sesame sauce on the cold noodles and toss to combine. Garnish with sesame seeds and green onions, if desired.
                            Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.
                            Before serving them again, toss with a little warm water to thin out the sauce.
                        </li><br>
